# Info CVUV
This is a customized Moodle plugin repository that will host documentation (e.g. privacy policies, tutorials, FAQs, and others) for users of the Campus Virtual at Universidad del Valle.

This was initially hosted at "https://campusvirtual.univalle.edu.co/moodle/info-dintev/" using single PHP files, now it's time for it to evolve to use the best Moodle practices.
